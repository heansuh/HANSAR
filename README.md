# HANSAR
**HANSAR** stands for Hybrid AI Navigated System with Affordable RAG, which makes use of LLM and other cost-effective tools and solutions that are integrated together.

The focus of this project is to explore and test the tools/solutions used as of now, to fit into the SMEs' (Small Medium Enterprises) use cases worldwidely.
Since most SMEs/freelancers do not have enough costs/resources to incorporate AI solutions in their system, the concept of HANSAR supports their capability to ensure lightweight use of AI solutions.

For this, the data pipelines need to be clearly defined and structured to meet the requirements.
